# MetagenOutLDA

A new library for R that allows a complete statistical analysis of metagenomic matrices from standard techniques. This library performs three basic tasks: 1) the estimation of metagenomic abundance profiles (relative abundance of species) for each sample using robust regression and their graphical representation, 2) estimation of different parameters metagenomic biodiversity alpha type and 3) performing a discriminant analysis (LDA, QDA, Support vector machine, LDA Robust, etc.) to distinguish between groups (healthy / sick, group1 / grup2, etc.) treatment studied and offer a percentage of correct classification.
